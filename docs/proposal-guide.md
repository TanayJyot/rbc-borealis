# Let's SOLVE It — Proposal Writing Guide

## Requirements

- **Length:** 500–1,000 words
- **Format:** PDF, DOC, DOCX, or RTF
- **Optional:** You may submit a secondary proposal (mentor picks between the two if selected)

## What the Proposal Must Cover

### 1. The Problem
- Clearly define the community problem you want to solve
- Be specific about who is affected and how

### 2. Why It Matters
- Explain why this problem is important to your team and/or community
- Include relevant statistics or evidence of impact
- Personal connection strengthens the proposal

### 3. Why Machine Learning Can Help
- Explain how ML techniques could address this problem
- You don't need to specify exact algorithms, but show you understand why ML is a reasonable approach
- Identify what patterns or predictions ML could extract from data

### 4. Data (2–3 Potential Datasets)
- Identify 2–3 datasets you could use
- Include links to datasets or data sources
- Explain what the data contains and how it relates to your problem
- Open data sources are ideal (government data, Open Data Network, Kaggle, etc.)

### 5. Connection to Coursework or Personal Projects
- Disclose if this project fulfills a coursework requirement
- Mention any related personal or extracurricular work
- This is informational — it does not disqualify you

### 6. Willingness to Pivot
- State that your team is willing to pivot to an alternative community project if selected and the mentor recommends it

## Tips from Successful Past Projects

Based on 23 projects across 3 cohorts, here's what works:

### Strong Problem Selection
- **Local/Canadian focus:** Shelter bed demand in Toronto, wildfires in BC, food bank needs in Vancouver
- **Clear impact:** Problems where ML predictions lead to actionable decisions
- **Quantifiable:** Include statistics (e.g., "9,000 people homeless each night in Toronto", "1 in 25 ED patients wait >24 hours")

### Good ML Framing
- Match the problem to an ML task: prediction, classification, recommendation, NLP, computer vision
- Common successful approaches: forecasting demand, classifying signals, generating recommendations, risk scoring
- Don't overcomplicate — a well-scoped Random Forest or neural network is fine

### Data Strategy
- Use existing open datasets as a starting point
- Government and institutional data (CDC, NASA, Statistics Canada) are strong sources
- Acknowledge if local data isn't available and explain how you'd adapt (e.g., "no Vancouver data, but North American datasets exist")

### Proposal Tone
- Genuine passion for the problem comes through in successful proposals
- Balance technical awareness with accessibility
- Show you understand the community impact, not just the technical challenge

## Example Proposal Structure (Based on the Official Example)

See: `docs/example-proposal.md` for the full official example

The official example follows this structure:
1. **"What is the problem?"** — Problem definition with statistics
2. **"Why is it important to me?"** — Personal connection and community impact
3. **"Why Machine Learning Can Help?"** — Technical reasoning
4. **"What Data to Use?"** — Specific datasets with links
