## 1. Predicting Drinking Water Advisories on First Nations Reserves

**Problem:** ~30 long-term drinking water advisories still active on First Nations reserves. Indigenous communities disproportionately affected by unsafe water — a uniquely Canadian crisis.

**ML Approach:** XGBoost/Random Forest classification to predict which water systems are at risk of issuing advisories based on system characteristics (age, source type, operator certification, province, population).

**Key Data:**
- ISC Long-term DWA dataset on Open Canada Portal
- StatCan environmental sustainability indicators
- XGBoost study achieved 86% accuracy on this exact problem

**Why #1:** Perfectly aligned with RBC Borealis equity mission. Uniquely Canadian. Government dataset readily available. Published ML research validates feasibility. Never done in past cohorts.

**Risk:** Sensitivity around Indigenous data sovereignty — proposal should acknowledge this respectfully.

**Deep dive:** `02-idea-indigenous-water-quality.md`

[//]: # Is this something that NEEDS ML to be predicted or is it something that can be just figured out otherwise anyways purely by the dataset, the other thing would also be the scale of the problem that we are trying to solve if it is relevant

## 2. Mapping and Predicting Food Deserts in Canadian Cities

**Problem:** Low-income neighborhoods with poor access to grocery stores. Disproportionately affects seniors, immigrants, and disabled persons. 62% of families in subsidized housing are food insecure.

**ML Approach:** Clustering (k-medians) to identify food desert areas + classification (decision trees/CHAID) to predict emerging food deserts from socioeconomic features.

**Key Data:**
- StatCan "Indices of food desert and accessibility to food shops" on Open Canada
- Can-FED pan-Canadian dataset (56,589 dissemination areas)
- StatCan Business Register food environment measures

**Why #2:** Government dataset purpose-built for this problem. Novel for this program. Clear community impact — results could inform city planning. Proven ML methodology in literature.

**Risk:** Mostly analysis/mapping rather than prediction — need to frame a forward-looking ML task.

**Deep dive:** `03-idea-food-desert-accessibility.md`

[//]: # same question of do we have enough emergence of food deserts for something like this to be useful?

## 3. Predicting Opioid Overdose Risk at Community Level

**Problem:** Canada's opioid crisis: 40,000+ deaths since 2016. BC hardest hit. Overdose rates surged during COVID and remain elevated.

**ML Approach:** Gradient boosting / logistic regression to predict community-level overdose risk from demographic, prescription, and social determinants. Literature shows 83.7% balanced accuracy.

**Key Data:**
- BC Opioid Overdose Analytical File (BCOOAF) — 13,318 records linked to StatCan
- StatCan health and social data
- Alberta administrative health data (428K+ patients)

**Why #3:** Extremely urgent Canadian issue. Strong published ML precedent. High impact — predictions could direct harm reduction resources.

**Risk:** Health data access may be restricted. May need to work with aggregated/public data rather than individual records. Sensitive topic requires careful framing.

**Deep dive:** `04-idea-opioid-overdose-prediction.md`

[//]: # Highly dependent on having the relevant dataset

## 4. Predicting Wildfire Smoke Health Impact on Communities

**Problem:** 2023 Canadian wildfires caused 49-5,400 premature deaths from smoke exposure. PM2.5 spikes cause respiratory hospitalizations. Affects entire population during fire season.

**ML Approach:** Random Forest / LSTM to predict PM2.5 exposure from weather + fire data, then correlate with health outcomes (ER visits, respiratory admissions).

**Key Data:**
- NAPS (260 stations, data since 1969) on Open Canada
- AQHI data with JSON/CSV API
- CIHI hospitalization data

**Why #4:** Different from past wildfire projects (health impact, not fire detection). Extremely timely after 2023. Excellent government data with API access. Clear actionable outcome (public health warnings).

**Risk:** Similar enough to past wildfire projects that reviewers might conflate them. Need to strongly differentiate the health angle.

**Deep dive:** `05-idea-wildfire-smoke-health.md`

[//]: How would you obtain an anonymised dataset to be able to train a supervised model on that has features about PM 2.5 Exposure and ER visits? What we can possibly do is look at

## 5. Predicting Housing Affordability Risk for Canadian Neighborhoods

**Problem:** 45% of Canadians very concerned about housing. Shelter costs up 25% since 2021. Rent up 24%. Nearly half of renters spend >30% of income on housing.

**ML Approach:** Regression to predict future affordability from economic indicators + classification to flag at-risk neighborhoods. Time-series forecasting of shelter-cost-to-income ratios.

**Key Data:**
- StatCan Canadian Housing Survey (annual)
- New Housing Price Index (monthly since 1981) on Open Canada
- Kaggle "Housing Affordability in Canada" competition dataset

**Why #5:** Universally relatable, strong data going back decades, clear ML task. Kaggle competition validates this as an ML-friendly problem.

**Risk:** More economics than social good. Less clear who the "community" beneficiary is. Weaker equity angle compared to top ideas.

**Deep dive:** `06-idea-housing-affordability.md`

[//]: This sounds kinda cool in terms of how you would predict price changes in different areas of the city based on factors. Pricing Trends data can we used as true label here and we can try mapping other factors to it

## 6. Predicting Transit Accessibility Gaps for Seniors

**Problem:** Elderly increasingly dependent on public transit. Declining physical capabilities + retirement income = transport poverty. Canada's population aging rapidly.

**ML Approach:** Accessibility scoring model combining transit data + demographics + facility locations. Predict underserved areas.

**Key Data:**
- StatCan 28 spatial accessibility measures (7 destinations x 3 transport modes x peak/off-peak)
- Metrolinx assessment data (GTHA)
- Municipal GTFS transit feeds

**Why #6:** Novel angle never attempted. Aging population is growing concern. Government data exists.

**Risk:** Hardest to scope tightly. Accessibility is multidimensional. May struggle to define a clean ML prediction task. Data integration across sources is complex.

**Deep dive:** `07-idea-transit-accessibility-seniors.md`

Is this a problem in Canada as a whole? Are there any surveys that indicate how much people do use public transport in old age and how accessible they are to them, what would be the use case for the model in the future

## Recommendation

**Primary proposal:** #1 (Indigenous Water Quality) or #2 (Food Deserts) — both have the highest combination of novelty, data quality, equity alignment, and ML feasibility.

**Secondary proposal:** #4 (Wildfire Smoke Health) — strong data, timely, different enough from primary to offer the mentor a real choice.
