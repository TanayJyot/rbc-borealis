# What Gets Accepted — Selection Criteria Analysis

Based on analysis of all 23 accepted projects across 3 cohorts (Spring 2023, Fall 2023, Spring 2024).

## Inferred Scoring Rubric

| Factor | Weight | What Reviewers Look For |
|---|---|---|
| **Canadian/Community Focus** | High | Problem directly affects a Canadian community. Local stats preferred. |
| **Clear ML Application** | High | Obvious ML task (prediction, classification, NLP, CV). Not forced. |
| **Data Availability** | High | 2-3 identified datasets. Open data ideal. Honest about gaps. |
| **Quantifiable Impact** | Medium | Specific statistics showing scale of problem. |
| **Feasibility in 2 Months** | Medium | Scoped narrowly enough for undergrads to deliver a demo. |
| **Novelty** | Medium | Fresh angle, not repeating past cohort projects. |
| **Equity/Diversity Angle** | Medium | Aligns with RBC Borealis + CIFAR inclusion mission. |
| **Personal Connection** | Low-Med | Team has lived experience or passion for the cause. |
| **Technical Sophistication** | Low | Simple models are fine. Random Forest to LLM — all accepted. |

## Patterns in Accepted Projects

### Domain Distribution (23 projects)
- Healthcare: 7 (30%) — ED wait times, radiology, stroke, anesthesia, transplant, glioblastoma, food bank
- Environment: 5 (22%) — wildfire x2, earthquake, crop yield, radon
- Social services: 4 (17%) — shelter x2, scholarship matching, food bank
- Accessibility/Mental health: 4 (17%) — ASL, chatbot, crisis companion, mental health
- Safety: 2 (9%) — driving behavior, tornado
- Education: 1 (4%) — feedback summarization

### ML Techniques Used
- Classification/prediction: Most common (Random Forest, XGBoost, neural nets, regression)
- NLP/LLM: 2-3 projects (chatbot, crisis companion)
- Computer vision: 2-3 projects (fire detection, radiology, ASL)
- Forecasting/time series: 3-4 projects (shelter demand, ED arrivals, tornado)

### What All Accepted Projects Share
1. Problem stated in first paragraph with a specific Canadian statistic
2. ML approach is a natural fit (not shoehorned)
3. At least one dataset identified (even if imperfect)
4. Solution leads to an actionable outcome (not just analysis)
5. Feasible demo in 2 months (web app, dashboard, model + evaluation)

## Topics to Avoid (Overdone or Risky)

| Topic | Why Avoid |
|---|---|
| Shelter bed forecasting | Done in both Fall 2023 and Spring 2024 |
| Wildfire prediction (fire detection) | Done in both Fall 2023 and Spring 2023 |
| Generic mental health chatbot | Done in Fall 2023 (MindTech) |
| Generic food waste | Done in Spring 2023 (FoodGPT) |
| Too-broad "climate change" | Hard to scope, no clear ML task |
| Pure NLP on social media | Hard to get actionable community impact |

## What Would Stand Out

- **Under-explored domains:** Indigenous issues, housing, transit, opioid crisis, air quality/health
- **Equity-centered problems:** First Nations water, food deserts in low-income areas, immigrant services
- **Timely issues:** Post-2023 wildfire health impact, opioid crisis escalation, housing affordability crisis
- **Novel ML angles on familiar problems:** Health impact of wildfires (not fire detection), community-level risk prediction (not individual patient)
